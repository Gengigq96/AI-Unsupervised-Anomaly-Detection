# AI-Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a dataset using multiple techniques, including Moving Average, Z-score, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). These methods are applied to identify outliers in different variables, with the goal of understanding how each technique behaves with different data characteristics and thresholds.
